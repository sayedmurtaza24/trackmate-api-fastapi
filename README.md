# TrackMate API - FastAPI

TrackMate is a 10 day project my colleagues and I made for our final project in Salt bootcamp.
Visit [Client](https://github.com/martindospel/final-project-client) and [Server](https://github.com/martindospel/final-project-server) for the original implementation of the project.

Since the project was only written in 10 days the backend code doesn't look very clean and the routes might not look
secure enough or grouped properly. And also since we regreted usage of MongoDB later when the project grew larger than
our MVP expectations I decided to clean things up, document it and learn things along the way.

This is a RESTful API made for TrackMate but this time written in Python using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

## Demo
Well, one of the great things about FastAPI other than being fast is autogenerated documentations out of the box.. yes documentations with a (s) at the end. FastAPI generates an `openapi.json` file on the fly when project is running and 
serves Swagger UI and Redoc to represent it in a nice way which I loved so much.

Documentations: [Swagger](https://trackmate.deta.dev/docs) or [Redoc](https://trackmate.deta.dev/redoc)

## The tech
* FastAPI of course
* SQLAlchemy with asyncpg (real fast combination)
* Firebase Admin Core and Authentication

## How to run
If you want to run this project on your local machine for some reason:
* Create a .env file in the root dir like this:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgrespw@localhost:5432
DEBUG=1
```
* Create a firebase project, enable Authentication and copy the service account json file to the
root directory and name it `firebase-admin.json`
* Run `docker compose up`
* The application will be running on http://localhost:4000
